# Session Summary: tree_at Optimization

## What We Did

### 1. Profiled make_module_opt with Tensor Parallelism
- Fixed TP plan patterns to match BERT structure (`*.intermediate.dense`, not `*.mlp.*`)
- Measured overhead of applying TP transformations during model initialization
- Found 24 transformations applied (6 patterns × 4 layers)

**Key Finding:** TP initialization adds 261ms overhead (31.3% slower)

### 2. Measured eqx.tree_at Overhead
Created `research/measure_tree_at_overhead.py` to instrument individual `tree_at` calls:
- Each `tree_at` call: ~5ms for BERT-4L (74 leaves)
- 24 transformations × 5ms = **121ms total** (93.2% of transformation time)
- Transform logic (calling column_parallel/row_parallel): only 8.8ms (6.8%)

### 3. Analyzed Scaling Behavior
Created `research/test_tree_at_scaling.py` to test different model sizes:

| Model Size | Leaves | tree_at Time | µs/leaf |
|------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| 2L-256H | 42 | 2.98ms | 70.90 |
| 4L-512H | 74 | 5.13ms | 69.30 |
| 4L-768H | 74 | 5.23ms | 70.65 |
| 8L-768H | 138 | 9.23ms | 66.90 |
| 12L-768H | 202 | 14.01ms | 69.34 |

**Perfect linear scaling (R² = 0.9987): ~68µs per leaf**

**Projected overhead for large models:**
- BERT-base (12L, 72 transforms): **1 second**
- GPT-3 scale (500 transforms): **34 seconds**

### 4. Implemented Batched tree_at Optimization
**Root cause:** Calling `eqx.tree_at` N times caused O(N × L) overhead

**Solution:** Batch all tree_at operations into a single call (O(L))

```python
# Before: N separate tree_at calls
for _, getter, replacement in sorted_matches:
    module = eqx.tree_at(getter, module, replacement)

# After: 1 batched tree_at call  
if matches:
    sorted_matches = sorted(matches, key=lambda item: len(item[0]))
    getters = [getter for _, getter, _ in sorted_matches]
    replacements = [replacement for _, _, replacement in sorted_matches]
    module = eqx.tree_at(
        lambda m: [getter(m) for getter in getters], module, replacements
    )
```

**Results:**
- **7.8× speedup** (133ms → 17ms for pure transformation)
- **7.5× speedup** (357ms → 47.5ms in make_module_opt)
- Reduced total TP overhead from 261ms to 149ms (31.3% → 18.0%)

### 5. Verified Correctness
- Tested that batched approach produces identical results
- Smoke tested with actual make_module_opt call
- ✅ All tests pass

## Performance Impact Summary

### BERT-4L-768H (24 transformations, 74 leaves)
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| apply_transforms | 357ms | 47.5ms | **7.5×** |
| tree_at overhead | 121ms | ~16ms | **7.6×** |
| Total TP overhead | 261ms | 149ms | **43% reduction** |

### Projected for BERT-base (72 transformations, 202 leaves)
- Before: ~1000ms
- After: ~50-100ms
- **~10-20× speedup**

### Projected for Large Models (500 transformations, 1000 leaves)
- Before: ~34 seconds
- After: ~1-2 seconds
- **~20-30× speedup**

## Key Numbers to Remember

- **tree_at cost:** 68µs per leaf (perfectly linear)
- **Batched speedup:** 7.5-7.8× for typical workloads
- **Overhead reduction:** From 31.3% to 18.0% for TP initialization

## Comparison: tree_at vs eqx.combine

From previous session + this session:

| Issue | When | Per-call Cost | Total Impact | Priority |
|-------|------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| **eqx.combine** | Every training step | 40ms | 40s per 1000 steps | **Critical** |
| **eqx.tree_at** | Model init (one-time) | 5ms/call | 121ms (BERT-4L) → 16ms (optimized) | Fixed ✅ |

## Next Steps (if needed)

The tree_at overhead is now **solved**. The remaining 18% TP overhead in make_module_opt comes from:
- JAX sharding/compilation setup
- Device communication
- Other initialization steps

These are inherent to distributed training and not worth optimizing further.

**Focus should remain on the eqx.combine overhead in the training loop** (40ms/step), which has much larger cumulative impact.
