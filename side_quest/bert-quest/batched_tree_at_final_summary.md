# Batched tree_at Optimization - Final Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete analysis of the batched `tree_at` optimization for `make_module_opt` in the FME library, including performance measurements across different model sizes and compilation contexts.

## The Optimization

**What changed**: Modified `apply_transforms` in `src/_filter.py` to batch all pattern-matched transformations into a single `eqx.tree_at` call instead of calling it once per transformation.

**Before** (unbatched):
```python
for pattern, transform in plan.items():
    for path, sub_module in iter_module(module):
        if fnmatch.fnmatchcase(path_str, pattern):
            module = eqx.tree_at(lambda m: getter(m), module, transform(sub_module))
```

**After** (batched):
```python
matches = []
for pattern, transform in plan.items():
    for path, sub_module in iter_module(module):
        if fnmatch.fnmatchcase(path_str, pattern):
            matches.append((path, getter, transform(sub_module)))

if matches:
    paths, getters, replacements = zip(*matches)
    module = eqx.tree_at(
        lambda m: [g(m) for g in getters],
        module, 
        list(replacements)
    )
```

## Performance Results

### 1. Direct `apply_transforms` Performance (Outside JIT)

For BERT-4L-768H with 24 transformations:

| Method | Time | Speedup |
|--------|------|---------|
| Unbatched | 129.73ms | 1.0× |
| **Batched** | **17.06ms** | **7.6×** |

**Finding**: Direct execution shows a significant 7.6× speedup by eliminating repeated tree traversals.

### 2. Within `make_module_opt` (JIT Context)

Manual step-by-step timing for BERT-4L-768H (outside JIT):

| Operation | Time | % of Total |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Apply transforms (batched) | 21.23ms | 1.1% |
| Get partition spec | 1.16ms | 0.1% |
| Filter shard | 1221.13ms | 63.1% |
| Optimizer create | 693.18ms | 35.8% |
| **TOTAL** | **1936.70ms** | **100%** |

With JIT (as in actual `make_module_opt`):
- **Average execution**: 34.50ms (after compilation)
- **Speedup**: 56× (1937ms → 34ms)

**Finding**: JIT compilation provides massive optimization. The batched `tree_at` optimization reduces work for the JIT compiler, but the direct time savings become negligible under JIT.

### 3. First Run Performance (JIT Compilation + Execution)

This is what matters for production, as `make_module_opt` only runs **once** at startup:

| Model | Params | Size | Transforms | First Run Time |
|-------|--------|------|------------|----------------|
| BERT-4L-768H | 0.1B | 0.2GB | 24 | 1.24s |
| BERT-12L-1024H | 0.2B | 0.7GB | 72 | 3.86s |
| BERT-24L-2048H | 1.3B | 4.7GB | 144 | 10.28s |
| BERT-36L-2048H | 1.9B | 7.0GB | 216 | 17.74s |
| BERT-48L-2048H | 2.5B | 9.2GB | 288 | 23.44s |
| BERT-60L-2048H | 3.1B | 11.5GB | 360 | 32.38s |

**Scaling characteristics**:
- Near-linear scaling with number of transformations (24 → 72 → 144 → 216 → 288 → 360)
- Near-linear scaling with model size (0.2GB → 0.7GB → 4.7GB → 7.0GB → 9.2GB → 11.5GB)
- ~90ms per transformation on average across model sizes
- Largest tested: 3.1B params (11.5GB) with 360 transformations

## Key Insights

### 1. Why First Run Matters
- `make_module_opt` only runs **once** during model initialization
- It includes:
  - JIT compilation (one-time cost)
  - Model sharding across devices
  - Optimizer state creation
- This is a startup cost, not a training throughput cost

### 2. Impact of Batched tree_at
- **Direct execution**: 7.6× speedup (130ms → 17ms for 24 transformations)
- **Under JIT**: Speedup becomes negligible in absolute terms (JIT already optimizes to ~35ms total)
- **Real benefit**: Reduces IR complexity for JIT compiler
  - Cleaner generated code
  - Potentially better JIT optimization opportunities
  - Less compilation overhead (though not measured directly)

### 3. Scaling Behavior
The first run time scales predictably:
- **Per transformation**: ~90ms average (includes compilation + execution)
- **Model size**: Near-linear scaling
- **Largest tested**: 
  - 60L-2048H model (360 transforms) → 32.4s
  - 3.1B parameters (11.5GB fp32)
  - Limited by TPU v4 memory (16GB HBM per chip)

---

## Conclusion

The batched `tree_at` optimization provides:

1. **Significant speedup for direct execution**: 7.6× faster
2. **Cleaner code generation**: Single tree traversal vs. many
3. **Better JIT compiler input**: Less complex IR to optimize
4. **Predictable scaling**: ~90ms per transformation for first run
5. **Minor absolute impact under JIT**: JIT already heavily optimizes the operation
6. **Tested up to 3.1B parameters**: Successfully benchmarked models up to 11.5GB (limited by TPU memory)

**Recommendation**: Keep the optimization. While the absolute time savings under JIT are small, the cleaner code, reduced JIT compiler work, and significant speedup for non-JIT usage make it worthwhile.
