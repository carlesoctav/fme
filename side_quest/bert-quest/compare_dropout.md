## Comparison: Dropout vs No Dropout

### Overhead Consistency

The preprocessing/postprocessing overhead is **remarkably consistent** across different model configurations:

| Configuration | Preprocess (ms) | Postprocess (ms) | Total Overhead (ms) | Step Duration Diff (ms) |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **No Dropout (SDPA)** | 12.5 | 34.3 | 46.8 | 47.2 |
| **With Dropout (Eager)** | 12.4 | 34.5 | 46.9 | 46.9 |

**Key Finding**: The filter_jit overhead is **independent of model computation** - it's purely a function of the model structure (pytree size/complexity).

### Performance Impact

|  | No Dropout (SDPA) | With Dropout (Eager) | Difference |
|--|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| **filter_jit** | 156.63 ms | 181.22 ms | +24.59 ms (+15.7%) |
| **manual_jit** | 109.43 ms | 134.32 ms | +24.89 ms (+22.7%) |
| **Overhead** | 47.20 ms | 46.90 ms | -0.30 ms (-0.6%) |

**Observations:**
1. Both methods slow down by ~25ms with dropout (due to more computation)
2. The filter_jit overhead remains constant at ~47ms
3. Dropout + eager attention increases compilation time significantly (4x longer)

### Speedup Analysis

- **No Dropout**: 1.27x speedup (156.63ms → 109.43ms)
- **With Dropout**: 1.23x speedup (181.22ms → 134.32ms)

The speedup is slightly lower with dropout because the additional computation time (dropout + eager attention) reduces the relative impact of the 47ms overhead.

## Root Cause (Same as No-Dropout Case)

### `eqx.filter_jit` Workflow (EVERY call)

1. **Preprocess** (~12.4ms): `hashable_partition(args, is_array)`
2. **JIT Execution**: Actual computation
3. **Postprocess** (~34.5ms): `combine(dynamic_out, static_out)`

**Total overhead**: ~47ms per call (regardless of dropout/attention implementation)

### Manual Partition/Combine Workflow

1. **Setup (ONCE)**: `params, static = eqx.partition(model, eqx.is_array)`
2. **Every Call**: `combine()` happens INSIDE JIT with static from closure

**Total overhead**: ~0ms (no pre/postprocessing)

## Implementation Code

### Changes for Dropout Version

```python
config = BertConfig(
    vocab_size=30522,
    hidden_size=768,
    num_hidden_layers=12,
    num_attention_heads=12,
    intermediate_size=3072,
    max_position_embeddings=512,
    type_vocab_size=2,
    hidden_dropout_prob=0.1,           # Changed from 0
    attention_probs_dropout_prob=0.1,  # Changed from 0
    _attn_implementation="eager",      # Changed from "sdpa"
)
```

## Key Insights

1. **Overhead is Structure-Dependent, Not Computation-Dependent**
   - The 47ms overhead is consistent regardless of dropout/attention implementation
   - It's purely a function of the model's pytree structure
   - More complex models (more layers, parameters) = more overhead

2. **Compilation Time Increases Significantly with Dropout + Eager**
   - No dropout (SDPA): ~55s compilation
   - With dropout (Eager): ~220s compilation (4x slower!)
   - This is due to eager attention being more complex to compile

3. **Speedup Decreases with More Computation**
   - 1.27x speedup when steps are fast (109ms vs 156ms)
   - 1.23x speedup when steps are slow (134ms vs 181ms)
   - The fixed 47ms overhead matters less when total time is higher

4. **Manual Partition/Combine Wins Regardless**
   - Consistent 47ms advantage across all configurations
   - Compounds over training (47ms × 10,000 steps = 470 seconds = 7.8 minutes saved)

## Recommendations

1. **Use manual partition/combine for training** to save ~47ms per step
2. **The benefit is larger for**:
   - Fast models (SDPA, no dropout)
   - Long training runs (thousands of steps)
   - Performance-critical applications

3. **Consider filter_jit for**:
   - Prototyping and development (simpler API)
   - Inference (fewer iterations)
   - When 47ms/step is acceptable overhead
